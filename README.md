Kefft-base
==================
 
A boilerplate for smaller websites or webbapplications using PHP.
 
Built by David Lidström as a part of the class "Databaser och objektorienterad programmering i PHP" at Blekinge Institute of Technology.

The name
------------------

The name is a acronym for the swedish "Please code in a uniform way using a nice file stucture":
 
<pre><strong>Kefft</strong> [ɕæftː] 
<strong>K</strong>oda <strong>e</strong>nhetligt med <strong>f</strong>in <strong>f</strong>ilstruktur, <strong>t</strong>ack</pre>

It's supposed to be pronounced according to the swedish word "käft", which basically means "maw". This is supposed
to motivate you to code in a correct manner or you will get punched in the maw, or "käftsmäll".
